My Air Quality Monitoring App üåçüí®




An innovative web application designed to provide real-time and predicted air quality information, along with AI-powered health advice based on current air conditions. Stay informed about the air you breathe and take proactive steps for your well-being.

üåü Features
Real-time Air Quality Data: Fetches live air quality measurements for specific locations using the OpenAQ API.
Comprehensive Pollutant Information: Displays concentrations for key pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3, SO2, and CO.
Intuitive AQI Categorization: Automatically categorizes air quality (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) with clear color indicators based on pollutant levels.
AI-Powered Health Advice: Integrates with the OpenAI API to provide personalized health recommendations and precautions based on the detected AQI category.
Mock Grid Data Visualization: Generates simulated air quality data across a geographical grid for broad spatial understanding.
Responsive Frontend: (Planned/Future) A user-friendly React interface for seamless interaction on various devices.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Backend (Flask - Python):

Flask: Web framework for building the API.
Requests: For making HTTP requests to external APIs (OpenAQ).
OpenAI: Python client for interacting with the OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-3.5 Turbo for health advice).
python-dotenv: For secure management of API keys via .env files.
Frontend (React - JavaScript):

React: (Planned) A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Mapbox GL JS / Leaflet: (Planned) For interactive map visualization of air quality data.
Axios / Fetch API: (Planned) For consuming backend API endpoints.
APIs & Data Sources:

OpenAQ API (v3): Provides free, real-time air quality data from around the world.
OpenAI API: Powers the intelligent health advice generation.
üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/my-air-quality-app.git
cd my-air-quality-app
(Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

2. Backend Setup (Flask)
The backend powers the data fetching and AI advice.

Install Python Dependencies
Navigate into the src/backend directory:

Bash

cd src/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt # (You'll need to create this file)
Note: If you don't have a requirements.txt yet, create it by running:

Bash

pip freeze > requirements.txt
(Make sure you've installed Flask, requests, openai, python-dotenv first: pip install Flask requests openai python-dotenv)

Configure API Keys
Get your OpenAQ API Key:

Sign up for a free API key at OpenAQ.org.
Get your OpenAI API Key:

Create an API key at platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
Create a file named .env in the src/backend directory (the same directory as app.py) and add your keys:

Code snippet

OPENAQ_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAQ_API_KEY_HERE"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"
IMPORTANT: Do not commit your .env file to GitHub! It's already included in the .gitignore file to prevent this.

Run the Backend Server
From the src/backend directory:

Bash

python app.py
The Flask development server will start, usually on http://127.0.0.1:5000. You'll see logs indicating that the API keys are loaded.

Bash

cd ../frontend
npm install # or yarn install
npm start # or yarn start
The React development server will start, usually on http://localhost:3000.

4. Access the Application
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:3000 (or whatever address your React app runs on).
